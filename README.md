# legacy - onchain

legacy - onchain is a mystical, blockchain-based platform inspired by *virasat* (heritage). It empowers users to craft a secure digital legacy, designating heirs to inherit assets like funds, NFTs, or videos, revealed only after their passing. With genie-inspired, customizable NFTs that unlock posthumously via smart contracts, legacy - onchain weaves an enduring, magical legacy on-chain.

## Features
- **Digital Vault**: Securely store funds, NFTs, or videos for posthumous sharing.
- **Heir Designation**: Assign trusted heirs to access specific assets.
- **Genie NFTs**: Create unique NFTs that unlock only after the ownerâ€™s death, verified on-chain.
- **Mystical UI**: A regal, genie-themed interface for an enchanting experience.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and blockchain verification ensure asset integrity.
